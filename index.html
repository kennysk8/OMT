  <h4> One More Try it is one the biggest lies that a skateboarder will tell you and their self.
  I think everyone has told this lie before, not just skateboarders. Have you ever
  tried the same thing for hours trying to accomplish that one goal and for some
  reason you always come up a little short and you tell yourself or someone One More
  try and you give it all you get, and you come up short again, just as you think
  your done you get this gut feeling or this voice in the back of your head that
  tells you to just give it one more shot and you know you can’t ignore so you give it
  another try giving it all you got once more, for most people if they fail there done trying. The thing is for some people that voice in the back of there had never shuts up until they do it especially for a skateboarder.

  <h1 class="freedom"> Freedom<h1>
  <h4> Every time I step on my board I get this sense of freedom. I know that
    there is no one that can tell me how to do what I’m doing because everyone has
    their own way of doing it. Skateboarding is what you make of it. <h4>
